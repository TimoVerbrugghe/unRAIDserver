# This is the main Samba configuration file. You should read the
# smb.conf(5) manual page in order to understand the options listed
# here. Samba has a huge number of configurable options (perhaps too
# many!) most of which are not shown in this example
#
# Any line which starts with a ; (semi-colon) or a # (hash)
# is a comment and is ignored. In this example we will use a #
# for commentry and a ; for parts of the config file that you
# may wish to enable
#
# NOTE: Whenever you modify this file you should run the command "testparm"
# to check that you have not made any basic syntactic errors.

###################################
# Port, Workgroup & Name Settings #
###################################

# SMB uses ports 139 & 445
	smb ports = 139 445

# workgroup = NT-Domain-Name or Workgroup-Name
	workgroup = WORKGROUP
# Don't care if the workgroup name is upper or lower case
	case sensitive = no

# server string is the equivalent of the NT Description field
	server string = ArchServer

####################
# Security options #
####################

# This option is important for security. It allows you to restrict
# connections to machines which are on your local network. The
# following example restricts access to two C class networks and
# the "loopback" interface. For more examples of the syntax see
# the smb.conf man page
	hosts allow = 192.168.0.

# Security mode. Most people will want user level security. See
# security_level.txt for details.
	security = user

# Don't allow the use of root for network shares
	invalid users = root

# File to map long usernames to shorter Unix usernames, if necessary
	username map = /etc/samba/smbusers

# Other password related options
passdb backend = tdbsam
obey pam restrictions = yes

# You may wish to use password encryption. Please read
# ENCRYPTION.txt, Win95.txt and WinNT.txt in the Samba documentation.
# Do not enable this option unless you have read those documents
;  encrypt passwords = yes
;  smb passwd file = /etc/samba/smbpasswd

# The following are needed to allow password changing from Windows to
# update the Linux sytsem password also.
# NOTE: Use these with 'encrypt passwords' and 'smb passwd file' above.
# NOTE2: You do NOT need these to allow workstations to change only
#        the encrypted SMB passwords. They allow the Unix password
#        to be kept in sync with the SMB password.
;  unix password sync = Yes
;  passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
;  passwd chat = *New*UNIX*password* %n\n *ReType*new*UNIX*password* %n\n *passwd:*all*authentication*tokens*updated*successfully*

#####################################
# Netbios/ Name Resolution Settings #
#####################################

# All NetBIOS names must be resolved to IP Addresses
# 'Name Resolve Order' allows the named resolution mechanism to be specified
# the default order is "host lmhosts wins bcast". "host" means use the unix
# system gethostbyname() function call that will use either /etc/hosts OR
# DNS or NIS depending on the settings of /etc/host.config, /etc/nsswitch.conf
# and the /etc/resolv.conf file. "host" therefore is system configuration
# dependant. This parameter is most often of use to prevent DNS lookups
# in order to resolve NetBIOS names to IP Addresses. Use with care!
# The example below excludes use of name resolution for machines that are NOT
# on the local network segment
# - OR - are not deliberately to be known via lmhosts or via WINS.

# Use either NetBIOS broadcast for name resolution or entries in the /etc/hosts file
	name resolve order = bcast host

# DNS Proxy - tells Samba whether or not to try to resolve NetBIOS names
# via DNS nslookups. The built-in default for versions 1.9.17 is yes,
# this has been changed in version 1.9.18 to no.
	dns proxy = no
 
# Domain master only applies to LANs that are inter-connected across a WAN
	domain master = no
 
# This machine is eligible to be a Master Browser and its priority is 4
# (the higher the os level, the more preferred to be Master Browser)
# (the maximum allowable value for os level is 255)
	preferred master = yes
	os level = 4
 
# Always advertise the shares automatically
	auto services = global
	server role = standalone server
